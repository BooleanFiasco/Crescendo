# Crescendo
Procedural roguelike with a 3D isometric perspective, a unique combat system and intuitive touch controls.

## Cloning the Crescendo repository
TODO: detail install Git/GitLFS/GitKraken, initial repository cloning.

## Getting the Crescendo engine build
The latest engine build can be found on our Google drive: [Crescendo/Engine Builds](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2s873J_IiIEV1FmVUgyUk95azQ)

Build archives names are standardized around when they were made - the last 8 characters of the name will be the date that the build was created in YYYYMMDD format. Thus, the most recent build will always be the *last* one listed in the folder (assuming there is more than one build).

To use the build, simply download it from the Google drive to your Crescendo project folder. It should look something like this:

Next, use 7-Zip to extract the archive in-place. Just right-click on it and choose 7-Zip > Extract Here. When it asks if you would like to replace files, click Yes.

Once the extraction is complete, you may need to associate the project with this engine installation. To do so, right-click on the Crescendo.uproject file and select "Switch Unreal Engine version...", then choose the installation in your project directory. You should only need to do this once - for subsequent engine updates it shoud not be necessary.
